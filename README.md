# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Intrusion Detection is one of the major concerns in the task of network administration and security. There is a need to safeguard the networks from known vulnerabilities and at the same time take steps to detect new and unseen, but possible, system abuses by developing more reliable and efficient IDS. This is the need of the present and it poses a challenging problem that needs to be solved more efficiently. In this project, the NIDS is developed in two parts â€“ First, to differentiate between normal connection and an intrusion and Second, to find the category of various types of attacks.
